Complete JavaScript Course to be learnt

                    
                    Now that we've learned HTML and CSS, we're able to build beautiful websites. But there's
                    one problem: they're static. There's no interaction with the users.

                    
                    In a website built only with HTML and CSS, users can just scroll up and down and click on links.
                    With Javascript we'll add a layer of interactivity that will make our websites much richer
                    in terms of usability.

                    
                    Users will be able to open and close menus, expand and collapse sections, 
                    navigate through photo sliders, use filters on product pages and much more.
                    <strong>With Javascript, our website will be dynamic!</strong>

                   
                   Javascript code can be written inside script tags. Those look just like normal HTML elements and
                   they can placed in the head or in the body section. For most cases the best place to include
                   the script tags will be at the end of the body element.
